/**
 * Bug: T401165 https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T401165
 * Job to record Terms of Use acceptance for all preexisting users.
 * This job should only be run ONCE to seed the data for terms of use users have agreed to before we started tracking it explicitly.
 * This job iterates through all users and creates a UserTermsOfUseAcceptance record
 *  for each, using the latest (only) Terms of Use version and the user's creation date as ToU acceptance date.
 * Errors during processing are logged and the job is marked as failed if accepting the terms of use for any user fails.
